					<h2>Facebook-parent Meta reports revenue drop for the first time</h2>
					<p>Meta Platforms issued a gloomy forecast after recording its first ever quarterly drop in revenue
					recently, with a global recession looming and competitive pressures weighing on its digital ads sales.Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company were down about 2.4% in extended trading.
					The company said it expects third-quarter revenue of between $26 billion and $28.5 billion. Analysts were expecting $30.52 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Total revenue, which consists almost entirely of ad sales, fell 1% to $28.8 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, from $29.1 billion last year. The figure slightly missed Wall Street'sprojections of $28.9 billion, according to Refinitiv.The company reported mixed results for usergrowth.Monthly active users on flagship social network Facebook came in slightly under analyst expectationsat 2.93 billion in the second quarter, an increase of 1% year over year, while daily active usershandily beat estimates at 1.97 billion.Like many global companies, Meta is facing some revenue pressure from the strong dollar, as sales inforeign currencies amount to less in dollar terms. Meta said it expected a 6% revenue growthheadwind in the third quarter, based on current exchange rates.Still, the Meta results also come as
					fortunes in online ads sales appear to be diverging between search and social media players, withthe latter impacted more severely as ad buyers reeling in spending.Alphabet Inc, the world's largest digital ad platform, reported a rise in quarterly revenue onTuesday, with sales from its biggest moneymaker, Google search, topping investor expectations.Snap Inc and Twitter both missed sales expectations last week and warned of an ad market slowdown incoming quarters, sparking a broad sell-off across the sector.The results shed light on the unique
					strain Meta's core social media business is experiencing, as it competes for users' time with shortvideo app TikTok and adjusts its ads business to privacy controls rolled out by Apple Inc lastyear."They are being greatly affected by everything, and I'd probably give it a third, a third and athird," Bokeh Capital Partners' Kim Forrest said, referring to the economy, global ad marketslowdown and competition from TikTok and Apple.</p>
